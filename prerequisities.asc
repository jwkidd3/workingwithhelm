= Prerequisites for Helm Class

Hello everyone, just some quick setup requirements for class.

Due to everyone likely using VPNs on their machine's sometimes that has caused some issues with installing some resources that we need for the class.  So, I am going to leave this up to you.

Either install _minikube_ or _KIND_ (Kubernetes in Docker).  If you do install minikube, be sure to have your VPN turned off, one of the results we got is that the VPN was intercepting some of the traffic from Minikube. On the other hand we found KIND (Kubernetes in Docker) to work well, with a little bit of setup. You can also use any alternative Kubernetes cluster you'd like

Tools you definitely need:

* Install Kubectl (https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
* Install Docker (https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

Minikube:

* Install Virtualbox (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads), which is a Saleforce recommended product
* Install Minikube (https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/)

*or*

Kind:

* Install Kind: (https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/)
* Run Kind using the following script which integrates with an ingress

[source, sh, subs="attributes,quotes,verbatim"]
----
$ cat <<EOF | kind create cluster --config=-
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
nodes:
- role: control-plane
  kubeadmConfigPatches:
  - |
    kind: InitConfiguration
    nodeRegistration:
      kubeletExtraArgs:
        node-labels: "ingress-ready=true"
        authorization-mode: "AlwaysAllow"
  extraPortMappings:
  - containerPort: 80
    hostPort: 80
    protocol: TCP
  - containerPort: 443
    hostPort: 443
    protocol: TCP
EOF

* Using kubectl, ensure that you are switch context to your kind kluster

[source, sh, subs="attributes,quotes,verbatim"]
----
$ kubectl config use-context kind-kind
----

* Run the following so we can deploy to kind

[source, sh, subs="attributes,quotes,verbatim"]
----
$ kubectl create clusterrolebinding add-on-cluster-admin --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=kube-system:default
