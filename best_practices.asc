== Best Practices

=== Embedded YAML Files
* In YAML, you can break up documents by flanking `----`, `....`
* In Helm, you can only have one embedded document in `values.yaml`
* Template files can have more than one document
** The combination is treated as one document during rendering
** Multiple documents are broken up by Kubernetes eventually
* Only use multiple documents when necessary

=== Indenting and Templates

* When needing to inject the contents of a file into templates
* Two ways to do so:
** Use `{{ .Files.Get "FILENAME" }}` to get the contents of a file in the chart.
** Use `{{ include "TEMPLATE" . }}` to render a template and then place its contents into the chart.

It is useful to do the following:
[source, yaml, subs="attributes,quotes,verbatim"]
----
myfile: |
{{ .Files.Get "myfile.txt" | indent 2 }}
----

NOTE: `indent 2` ensures that content is correctly indented, ensure that the template is flush to the left at column 0
